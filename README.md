# Miniquiz Documentation

The source code stored in this repository **is not** the Miniquiz application. 
You can find the Miniquiz source code [here](https://github.com/yoannfleurydev/mini-quiz).

This repository is used to store the source code of the report we had to do for our project.
Feel free to add an issue if there is a compilation or a typo problem.
